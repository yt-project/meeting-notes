The yt community is proud to announce the release of yt-4.0!

yt (http://yt-project.org) is an open source, community-developed toolkit for analysis and visualization of volumetric data.

This release features a complete reworking of a number of internal components, most importantly those related to particles and discrete points.  In keeping with this, we expect that some scripts used for analysis will require modifications; information about "what's new" as well as instructions for how to update analysis scripts can be found at: https://yt-project.org/docs/4.0.0/yt4differences.html .

This release has been years in the making, and features contributions from dozens of individuals, many of whom were new to the project.  It marks the culmination of a set of wide-reaching infrastructure changes that result in much higher fidelity to the underlying data for particle datasets.

At the end of this email you can find a non-exhaustive list of individuals who have contributed to this release; many of them made their first contribution during this release!
